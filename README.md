# Machine-Learning
a.I found the data on Kaggle under the project named ‘Lung Capacity Data’.
To ensure that my data was appropriate I first checked that whether all the required variables were present and then I ensured that their is enough data after cleansing.


b. I first find it a little hard to find the data set. Then after finding the dataset I saw that at some places there were no elements so I used ‘drop()’ function to remove those rows. Then to convert values like ‘yes’ and ‘no’ I first used ‘loc’ to remove any element other than ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Then I used Label Encoder to convert those values to either 0 or 1. Then I used Random Forest Regressor to increase my accuracy while training my model.


c.You should have installed pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn in your device before runing the code.
To install these,run the command below in your terminal:
  '!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn'
